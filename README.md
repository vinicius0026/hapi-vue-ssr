# Vue.js SSR with Hapi.js

This is a POC for running a server side rendered Vue.js app, backed by a Hapi.js
server.

The SSR structure was inspired by
[Vuetify SSR template](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/webpack-ssr).

Further documentation can be found at
[Vuetify SSR Guide](https://vuetifyjs.com/guides/server-side-rendering) or
at [Vue.js SSR Guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/)

# Running

If you are here, you probably know the drill:

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

Just make sure you are using node > 8, since Hapi.js v17 only supports the most
recent node releases.
